## üîç MANDATORY: Deep Code Analysis Required

Before creating any context files, you MUST perform a thorough analysis of EVERY file in the codebase:

### 1. File System Scan
\`\`\`bash
# First, understand the complete structure
find . -type f -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" | head -100
find . -type f -name "*.css" -o -name "*.scss" -o -name "*.module.css" | head -20
find . -type f -name "*.json" -o -name "*.yaml" -o -name "*.yml" | head -20
\`\`\`

### 2. Core Source Files Analysis

#### Components (if React/Vue/Angular)
- [ ] Open and read EVERY component file
- [ ] Identify component patterns (functional vs class)
- [ ] Note prop patterns and type definitions
- [ ] Detect state management approach
- [ ] Find naming conventions from actual files
- [ ] Identify styling approach (CSS modules, styled-components, Tailwind classes)

#### Business Logic
- [ ] Read ALL service/API files
- [ ] Understand data fetching patterns
- [ ] Identify error handling patterns
- [ ] Note authentication implementation
- [ ] Find API endpoint patterns
- [ ] Detect data transformation patterns

#### State Management
- [ ] Identify state management library from actual usage
- [ ] Read store definitions
- [ ] Understand action/reducer patterns
- [ ] Note state structure
- [ ] Find data flow patterns

#### Routing
- [ ] Analyze route definitions
- [ ] Identify route protection patterns
- [ ] Note dynamic routing usage
- [ ] Find navigation patterns

### 3. Pattern Detection from Code

#### Naming Conventions (detect from actual files)
\`\`\`typescript
// Analyze at least 20 files to determine:
- Component naming: PascalCase? kebab-case?
- File naming: index.ts? ComponentName.tsx?
- Hook naming: useXxx? useXxxHook?
- Service naming: apiService? ServiceAPI?
- Constant naming: SCREAMING_SNAKE? camelCase?
\`\`\`

#### Import Patterns
\`\`\`typescript
// Check how imports are structured:
- Absolute imports? '@/components'
- Relative imports? '../../../components'
- Barrel exports? 'from ./components'
- Grouped imports? React first, then libraries, then local?
\`\`\`

#### Error Handling
\`\`\`typescript
// Find actual error handling patterns:
- try/catch patterns
- Error boundary usage
- Toast/notification patterns
- Logging approach
- Error recovery strategies
\`\`\`

### 4. Technology Stack Detection

#### From Actual Usage (not just package.json)
- [ ] CSS approach: Check actual style files
- [ ] UI library: Look for component imports
- [ ] Form library: Find form implementations
- [ ] HTTP client: Check API call patterns
- [ ] Date library: Look for date formatting
- [ ] Animation: Find animation usage

#### Version Compatibility
- [ ] Check for deprecated pattern usage
- [ ] Note modern vs legacy approaches
- [ ] Identify polyfills or shims

### 5. Code Quality Indicators

#### Type Safety
- [ ] Count any types vs proper types
- [ ] Check interface vs type usage
- [ ] Note type assertion patterns
- [ ] Find generic usage patterns

#### Testing
- [ ] Read test files to understand testing patterns
- [ ] Note test file locations
- [ ] Identify testing utilities used
- [ ] Check coverage approach

### 6. Architecture Understanding

#### Dependency Graph
\`\`\`typescript
// Analyze imports to understand:
- Which modules depend on which
- Circular dependency risks
- Layer separation (UI -> Business -> Data)
- Shared utility usage
\`\`\`

#### Code Organization
- [ ] Feature-based vs layer-based
- [ ] Monorepo structure understanding
- [ ] Shared code patterns
- [ ] Build configuration analysis

## üìä Analysis Output Requirements

After analysis, you should be able to answer:

1. **Actual Tech Stack** (from code, not package.json)
   - UI framework and version patterns
   - CSS approach and utility usage
   - State management implementation
   - Form handling approach
   - API communication patterns

2. **Real Naming Conventions** (from actual files)
   - Component naming: [Examples from code]
   - File naming: [Examples from code]
   - Variable naming: [Examples from code]
   - Function naming: [Examples from code]

3. **Code Patterns** (from implementations)
   - Error handling: [Actual examples]
   - Loading states: [Actual examples]
   - Data fetching: [Actual examples]
   - Authentication: [Actual examples]

4. **Architecture Patterns** (from structure)
   - Module organization
   - Dependency flow
   - Shared code approach
   - Build setup

5. **Quality Metrics** (from analysis)
   - Type safety level
   - Test coverage approach
   - Code consistency
   - Performance patterns

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Evidence-Based Documentation

When filling templates, EVERY assertion must be backed by evidence:

‚ùå BAD: "Project uses React hooks"
‚úÖ GOOD: "Project uses React hooks (found useState in 47 files, useEffect in 38 files, custom hooks in src/hooks/)"

‚ùå BAD: "Naming convention is PascalCase for components"
‚úÖ GOOD: "Components use PascalCase (Button.tsx, UserCard.tsx, NavigationMenu.tsx found in src/components/)"

‚ùå BAD: "Project uses Zustand for state"
‚úÖ GOOD: "State management uses Zustand v4.5.7 (store definitions in src/stores/, used in 23 components)"

## üéØ Analysis Execution Order

1. **Start with entry points**
   - index.ts/main.ts/app.ts
   - Root component (App.tsx)
   - Route definitions

2. **Follow imports to understand structure**
   - Read each imported file
   - Build mental dependency map
   - Note patterns as you go

3. **Deep dive into core modules**
   - Most imported modules first
   - Business logic centers
   - Shared utilities

4. **Scan for patterns**
   - After reading 20+ files, patterns emerge
   - Document with specific examples
   - Note exceptions to patterns

## üö´ DO NOT

- Don't assume patterns from file names alone
- Don't trust package.json without verifying usage
- Don't skip reading actual implementations
- Don't generalize from just 2-3 files
- Don't ignore test files - they reveal patterns too

Remember: The context files are only as good as the analysis. A superficial scan leads to incorrect patterns and bad AI code generation!`;

## Deep Analysis Instructions

### Phase 1: Discovery (Read Everything)
1. Start at project root, read ALL configuration files
2. Follow src/ or source code directory
3. Read EVERY .ts/.tsx/.js/.jsx file
4. Read ALL .css/.scss/.module.css files
5. Read test files to understand testing approach
6. Read build configuration files

### Phase 2: Pattern Recognition
After reading files, identify:
- Repeated patterns (must appear in 5+ files)
- Naming conventions (with 10+ examples)
- Import structures (with examples)
- Error handling (with code snippets)
- Component patterns (with implementations)

### Phase 3: Architecture Understanding
- Draw the dependency graph mentally
- Understand data flow
- Identify architectural layers
- Note coupling and cohesion

### Phase 4: Evidence Collection
For EVERY pattern claimed, collect:
- File paths where pattern is found
- Code snippets demonstrating pattern
- Counter-examples if any
- Frequency of pattern usage

### Phase 5: Validation
Before writing templates:
- Can you answer all verification prompts?
- Do you have code evidence for every claim?
- Have you read at least 80% of source files?
- Can you explain the architecture?

Only proceed to template creation after completing ALL phases!
