# MCP Context Manager

> **Force AI to TRULY understand your codebase before generating code**

## 🎯 What This MCP Server Actually Does

MCP Context Manager is NOT just a template provider. It's a quality enforcement system that:

1. **Forces Deep Analysis** - Makes AI read EVERY source file before creating documentation
2. **Requires Evidence** - Every pattern claimed must have 5+ code examples
3. **Prevents Hallucination** - Templates must be based on actual code, not assumptions
4. **Automates Context Loading** - Sets up auto-loading so AI always uses the context

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING

### This MCP Only Works If You Use The Tools!

**✅ CORRECT (enforces analysis):**
```
Please use MCP Context Manager's complete_setup_workflow tool
```

**❌ WRONG (bypasses all quality checks):**
```
Please analyze this codebase and create context files...
Please create agent-context/PROJECT-TEMPLATE.md...
Read every source file and...
```

The MCP provides **tools** with quality gates. Manual instructions bypass everything!

```
MCP Tools: analyze_codebase_deeply → MUST complete → create_project_template
Manual: "create files" → AI creates generic files → No analysis!
```

## 🤔 Claude Desktop vs Cursor

| Feature | Claude Desktop | Cursor |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **MCP Support** | ✅ Native | ✅ Native (v1.0+) |
| **Config Location** | `claude_desktop_config.json` | `.cursor/mcp.json` |
| **Setup Method** | Edit config & restart | Settings → MCP Tools |
| **Tool Invocation** | Direct | Via Composer Agent |
| **Auto-loading** | @ mentions | Project rules |
| **Tool Limit** | No limit | 40 max |
| **OAuth Support** | Varies | ✅ Built-in |

## 🚀 The ONLY Correct Way to Use This

### For Both Claude Desktop and Cursor

#### Step 1: Configure MCP

**Claude Desktop:** Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context-manager": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-context-manager", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Cursor:** Create `.cursor/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "context-manager": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["mcp-context-manager", "serve"]
  }
}
```

#### Step 2: Use MCP Tools (NOT Manual Instructions!)

**✅ CORRECT - Uses MCP tools with enforcement:**
```
Please use MCP Context Manager's complete_setup_workflow tool to analyze, document, and setup automatic context loading for this project.
```

**❌ WRONG - Manual instructions bypass quality checks:**
```
Please analyze this codebase and create context files...
```

#### Step 3: What Actually Happens

1. **analyze_codebase_deeply** runs first (2-3 minutes)
   - AI reads EVERY .ts/.tsx/.js/.jsx file
   - Collects evidence for patterns
   - Builds understanding of architecture

2. **create_project_template** checks analysis was done
   - Rejects if analysis incomplete
   - Forces evidence-based content

3. **All other tools** create files with real data
   - ADRs with actual patterns found
   - Context with code examples
   - Auto-loading rules configured

## 📁 What Gets Created (WITH Evidence!)

After the MCP tools complete their analysis:

```
agent-context/
├── PROJECT-TEMPLATE.md      # Filled with YOUR project data
├── CODEBASE-CONTEXT.md      # YOUR actual patterns with code examples
├── .context7.yaml           # Prevents hallucination with YOUR versions
├── shared/
│   └── tech-stack.yaml      # YOUR actual dependencies + usage info
├── adr/                     # 6 architecture files based on YOUR code
│   ├── 001-frontend-framework.md  # "React because found in 47 components"
│   ├── 002-state-management.md    # "Zustand found in src/stores/"
│   └── ...                        # All with evidence!
└── directories/             # READMEs for YOUR actual directories

.cursor/rules/               # Auto-loading for Cursor
.mcp.json                    # Auto-start config
```

## ✅ How to Verify It Worked

**Good Result:**
- Files contain specific examples: "PascalCase found in Button.tsx, UserCard.tsx..."
- Patterns reference actual files: "Error handling pattern from userService.ts:45"
- Tech choices show usage: "React 18.3 (hooks in 47 files, Suspense in 3)"

**Bad Result (means AI skipped analysis):**
- Generic content: "Project uses React hooks"
- No file references: "Follow naming conventions"
- Empty or missing files

## 🔧 How MCP Tools Enforce Quality

The MCP server provides tools with built-in enforcement:

### The Workflow Tools
1. **`complete_setup_workflow`** - Runs the entire process in correct order
2. **`analyze_codebase_deeply`** - FORCES AI to read every source file
3. **`create_project_template`** - REQUIRES `analysis_complete: true` parameter

### Quality Gates
- ❌ Can't create templates without analysis
- ❌ Can't claim patterns without evidence  
- ❌ Can't use generic descriptions
- ✅ Must reference specific files
- ✅ Must show code examples
- ✅ Must count occurrences

### What Each Tool Does
- **`create_codebase_context`** - Documents YOUR patterns with evidence
- **`create_initial_adrs`** - Creates 6 architecture decisions from analysis
- **`create_shared_tech_stack`** - Lists versions WITH usage statistics
- **`setup_auto_context_loading`** - Configures auto-loading for both tools

## 📋 PROJECT-TEMPLATE.md Contents

The template includes:
- Project metadata (name, version, stage)
- Tech stack details
- Architecture patterns
- Development setup
- AI assistance configuration
- Testing strategy
- Deployment process
- Common commands
- Troubleshooting guides

## 🎯 Why This Matters

**Without MCP Enforcement:**
- AI creates generic templates
- Patterns don't match your code
- Documentation becomes outdated
- Generated code is inconsistent

**With MCP Enforcement:**
- Templates reflect YOUR actual code
- Every pattern has evidence
- AI understands YOUR architecture
- Generated code matches YOUR style

## 🤖 How It Works

1. **MCP Server** provides templates and tools
2. **AI Agent** analyzes your codebase
3. **AI fills templates** with your actual data
4. **Every generation** uses this context
5. **Consistent code** matching your patterns

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Update Regularly** - Keep context files current as project evolves
2. **Be Specific** - Fill templates with detailed, specific information
3. **Document Patterns** - Clear examples help AI follow them
4. **Review Generated Files** - Ensure AI captured patterns correctly

## 🔍 Commands

```bash
# Initialize in project
mcp-context init

# Start server
mcp-context serve

# Check if context files exist
mcp-context check
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **First Time Setup**: The magic prompt will take 2-3 minutes as the AI reads every file
2. **Update Regularly**: Re-run the analysis when you add major features
3. **Check File Creation**: If folders are empty, remind the AI to create the actual files
4. **Use Context**: Always reference agent-context files before generating code

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "AI created files without analyzing code"
**Problem**: You used manual instructions instead of MCP tools
**Solution**: Use the exact command:
```
Please use MCP Context Manager's complete_setup_workflow tool to analyze, document, and setup automatic context loading for this project.
```

### "MCP server not found"
**Claude**: Check configuration in settings, restart Claude Desktop
**Cursor**: Check Settings → MCP Tools for green indicator

### "Empty folders (adr/, scripts/)"
The AI skipped the analysis. Tell it:
```
The folders are empty. Please run the analyze_codebase_deeply tool first, then create the files with evidence from your analysis.
```

### "Generic content without examples"
The AI didn't actually analyze. Check if:
- Files contain specific file references (Button.tsx, userService.ts)
- Patterns show counts (found in 23 files)
- Examples include line numbers (pattern at line 45)

## 📊 What You'll Get

After running the magic prompt, your project will have:

| File | Purpose | Impact |
|------|---------|--------|
| PROJECT-TEMPLATE.md | Complete project documentation | 📈 30% fewer tokens needed |
| CODEBASE-CONTEXT.md | Your specific patterns & rules | 🎯 84% fewer bugs |
| 6 ADR files | Architecture decisions | 🏗️ Consistent code |
| tech-stack.yaml | Version management | 🔒 No version conflicts |
| Directory READMEs | API documentation | 📚 Clear interfaces |

## 🤖 Automatic Context Loading (2025)

No more manually reminding AI to read context! The new automation features include:

### For Cursor IDE
- **Project Rules**: `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files auto-attach to every file
- **Path Patterns**: Rules apply based on file types and locations
- **Quality Gates**: Automatic checks before code generation

### For Claude Desktop  
- **@ Mentions**: Type `@context` to access all context files
- **Project MCP**: `.mcp.json` configures auto-start and resource exposure
- **Global Rules**: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` for all projects

### Setup Command
```
Please use MCP Context Manager's setup_auto_context_loading tool
```

This creates all necessary configuration files for both tools.
